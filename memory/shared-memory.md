# Shared Memory

## Current Project

Health quiz funnel full-stack challenge for Ruiqi Technology (睿迄科技).
5-day delivery. MVP is merged to `main`; post-MVP frontend polish is
under Codex review on `feature/frontend-polish` at `8f6f80a`. ADR-001…014
are Accepted.

## Final Goal

Deliver a public demo URL, GitHub repo with README, API docs, DB schema
diagram, and an AI collaboration retrospective within 5 days. The
deployed app must walk an anonymous user through the funnel, gate the
result on a mock `POST /api/v1/pay`, and return the full result after
payment.

## Confirmed Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 App Router (UI + API route handlers)
- TypeScript (strict)
- Prisma + PostgreSQL on Supabase (Free tier)
- Zod at every API boundary
- Vercel (Hobby tier, region iad1)

## Confirmed Delivery Decisions

- Demo copy starts in English.
- Calculator uses Mifflin-St Jeor BMR × activity factor with the accepted
  calorie deficit/surplus and safety floors.
- `/api/v1/pay` silently no-ops for already-paid sessions even if a new
  `Idempotency-Key` is sent; it returns the existing entitlement and does
  not insert a second `payment` row.

## Confirmed MVP Flow

1. Visitor lands on the funnel.
2. `POST /api/v1/sessions` creates an anonymous session and sets a
   signed httpOnly cookie.
3. Visitor completes 6 steps: gender, main_goal, age, height,
   weight + target_weight, activity_level.
4. Each step is persisted via `PATCH /api/v1/sessions/me/steps/:stepKey`
   with Zod validation and the first-incomplete-step rule (ADR-008).
5. Refresh / close / reopen resumes from the first incomplete step.
6. `POST /api/v1/sessions/me/submit` runs the server-side calculator and
   writes a `result` row.
7. `GET /api/v1/results/me` returns a teaser for free sessions
   (BMI + category + headline) or full data for paid sessions.
8. Paywall CTA navigates to `/pay`.
9. `POST /api/v1/pay` requires an `Idempotency-Key`, writes the first
   `payment` row, and flips `session.entitlement_status` to `paid` in
   one DB transaction (ADR-006). Already-paid sessions silently no-op
   on later pay attempts (ADR-012).
10. Visitor reloads the result page and sees the full payload.

## Non-goals

- Real payment provider
- Real authentication (email / OAuth / magic link)
- Recurring `subscription` table or expiry semantics (ADR-007)
- Multi-device or cross-device session resume
- BetterMe UI clone (functional and trustworthy is enough)
- ML / personalised recommendation
- Email / notifications
- Admin dashboard
- Sentry / APM
- Production-grade rate limiting (DB-enforced idempotency only)

  migration (ADR-009 accepted on Day 5)
- Test suite → `tests/**` (vitest, 184 tests)
- ADR log → `memory/decisions.md` (ADR-001…014 Accepted)
- Open questions → `memory/open-questions.md` (no open blocker)
- Latest reviews → `reviews/review-008-frontend-polish.md` (Open: no Blocking, 1 Important auto-advance error-state reset issue); `reviews/review-004-final.md` (Resolved at `f2b37f8`); `reviews/review-007-browser-smoke.md` (Resolved); `reviews/review-006-day3.md` (Resolved); `reviews/review-002-api.md` and `reviews/review-003-db.md` are resolved for earlier branches.

## Current Branch

`feature/frontend-polish` — post-MVP UI-only branch. Ships single-choice
auto-advance with 250ms confirm flash, client-only `viewStep` editing,
`LockedPreview`, report-style full results, and pay-page polish. Codex
reviewed `8f6f80a` on 2026-05-19: `typecheck`, 184 tests, build, and
`db:validate` pass; preview smoke passes the main polish flow. One
Important remains before merge: single-choice auto-advance must clear
`selecting` after a failed save.
